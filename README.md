# Banking Management System
### Problem Statement
<hr>
JP Morgan Chase Bank is a leading global financial institution. It faces 
challenges in managing its vast and diverse customer base, complex 
transactions, and extensive branch operations. The current system lacks the 
efficiency and user-friendliness required to handle the growing demands of 
modern banking. This results in operational inefficiencies, delayed customer 
service, and potential security risks. <br>
<br>To address these issues, our project aims to develop a comprehensive Bank 
Management System that will streamline banking operations, enhance 
customer service, and improve data management efficiency. The proposed 
system will provide robust functionalities for customer management, 
account handling, transaction processing, employee management, branch 
operations, and loan management. By implementing this system, JP Morgan 
Chase Bank will be able to offer seamless banking experience, ensure data 
integrity and security, and maintain a competitive edge in the financial 
industry.
